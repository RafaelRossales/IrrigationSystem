## Overviewing The Project

The actual project has the purpose to regard the development skills obtained in the academic enviroment.In addition, 
the project will be able to supply the communication between hardware and software, working on Internet of Things (IoT) con-cepts.

<p>The system is going to be an object of study in the Development Project discipline from Faculdade de Tecnologia Senac Pelotas-RS (FATEC) , also the project is being guided by the professor Dr.Edécio Iépsen.</p>

 Status: **Building** :construction:
 
## Requirements:

**Arduino Uno R3**

The [Arduino UNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino_Uno) is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The board has 14 Digital pins, 6 Analog pins, and programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) via a type B USB cable. It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is also similar to the Arduino Nano and Leonardo.The hardware reference design is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license and is available on the Arduino website. Layout and production files for some versions of the hardware are also available.

**Módulo WiFi ESP8266 NodeMcu ESP-12**

[NodeMCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU) is an open source IoT platform.It includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module. The term "NodeMCU" by default refers to the firmware rather than the development kits. The firmware uses the Lua scripting language. It is based on the eLua project, and built on the Espressif Non-OS SDK for ESP8266. It uses many open source projects, such as lua-cjson and SPIFFS.
